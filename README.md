# Beep detection dataset

### Description

This is a set of generated audiofiles containing beep (voicemail tone) sounds of various frequency, duration and distortion. This set also contains some files containing silence or voice without any beep sounds.

I've generated all these files for answering machine detection model training, as I wasn't able to find enough ready-to-use beep recordings.

Feel free to use these files as you wish.
